Backstory: <br>
  For my project in CSCI 430, we are trying to build an autonomous RC-Car, dubbed ‘Project-MT’, or ‘Project Mini Tesla’.  The car should be controlled via user input, and will be utilizing computer vision to be able to maneuver around objects in its path.  Because of all the functionality we need from this car (controlling 4 motors, attaching a camera, streaming video to a desktop, taking control input from the desktop), I acquired this Raspberry Pi 4 to do the job.

My experience:<br>
  This being my first interaction with any Raspberry Pi, I’m happy to say I’ve been having a very **satisfying** experience.  Out of the box it has a quickstart guide if you are just trying to get it working right away, and it also has a very well formatted and informative manual if you want to dive deeper.  It comes with a micro-sd card that's preloaded with the operating system as well, so no initial software setup is required.  The pi also comes with many ports that are very **useful** when trying to connect external devices (2 micro HDMI ports, 4 USB ports, and 1 ethernet port).  I plugged in the power, hdmi, keyboard and mouse, and before I knew it I was off to the races.  It was up and fully functional in less than a couple minutes out of the box.  The process of connecting electronics to the pi was easy as well.  For each of the 4 motors, you simply take the wire already attached to the motor, and connect it to one of the pins on the pi (the row of pins sticking upright, near the top of the pi in the picture).  From there, you identify which pin number you connected the wire to, and you can easily toggle when power is being sent to the pin.  I thought establishing communication between the motors and the pi was going to be a cumbersome task, but thankfully the pi made it a very **efficient** process.  The pi also had a designated port for external cameras.  

  Overall, I would say this was a great user experience.  The pi is an extremely **learnable** device, even if you don’t have any experience with microcomputers.  It’s very **effective** in all things it sets out to achieve, and on top of that it is very **error tolerant**.  The only way you could run into errors while utilizing the pi is when you are trying to install software that didn’t come with the system, but the amount of errors you encounter during that process is entirely up to how experienced the user is.  Due to this, I wouldn’t say this pi is in any way **unsafe**.  Overall, I am very content with my first experience using a raspberry pi, and I can safely say this is a very **memorable** experience.
