Backstory: <br>
  When I was a sophomore in highschool, I built my first computer since I was really into computer games at the time,
and I didn’t want to keep battling my family for use of the family machine.  At the same time I built my computer,
I also purchased my first mechanical keyboard, which was a Razer BlackWidow Mechanical Keyboard.  Mechanical keyboards 
are sought after because they offer a much more satisfying experience in terms of their sound, feel, feedback, and layout.  
They also offer an unbelievable amount of customizability, starting from the feel and accuracy of the switches, to what color 
and material your keycaps are made out of, and even to the overall layout of the keyboard.  While I did like this keyboard 
for some time, I eventually got tired with how loud and clicky it was, and also with how much room it took up on my desk given 
I didn’t use over half the keys on the board.

My Experience: <br>
  The Keychron K6 keyboard is a 65% (referring to the size of a standard keyboard) keyboard, with a plethora of options when 
it comes to the switch type and the keyboard material.  Due to its size, this board is very **effective** at being something you 
can fit in your bag and take almost anywhere.  I opted to go for the Brown LK Optical switches with an aluminum chassis for the 
board.  The color of the switch (Brown) often refers to how loud it will be when you press on a key, examples of quietest to loudest 
is Black, Brown, Blue, Red.  The type of switch the key is (LK Optical) also affects how it feels, but is more geared towards how 
fast the keypress will be registered.  The Keychron K6 is hands down the most **satisfying** keyboard I have ever typed on.  The Brown 
Optical switches provide a great typing feel, while also not being too loud, which is what I was aiming for after my previous keyboard.
Due to how satisfying it is to use, this board has become **memorable** to the point where I could probably identify it by its feel,
with my eyes closed.

  This board also can be used in a wired or wireless mode, with a wireless battery life of 240 hours with the backlight off.  This is 
extremely **useful** as it can be wirelessly connected to 3 devices as once, and it takes less than 5 seconds to swap between devices 
with a keyboard command.  This was a very **efficient** feature for me when I was doing my semester-long project on a raspberry pi, since 
I didn’t have to further crowd my desk by having another keyboard connected to the pi.  If you haven't typed on a less than full size 
keyboard before, there is a slight **learning** curve to getting comfortable at typing on this board.  Overall I would say using this board 
has been a very **safe** and **error tolerant** experience.  The only way to damage or break this board is by spilling a decent amount of liquid 
on it, which I have already done.  I spilled an almost full 32oz hydro flask on it from some soft drink, and all I had to do was remove 
each keycap to wipe them down, then it performed good as new.
